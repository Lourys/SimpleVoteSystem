# IvernyaVotes

This plugin is a voting plugin designed to be put on a BungeeCord server, its purpose is to provide compatibility for voting sites, which do not support votifier.

## As a server owner, how can I install the plugin on my server?

### I advise you to divide the installation process in two steps:

#### The first one is to configure the database
So you have to go to the config.yml file generated by the plugin at the first start, and look at the database key:
```yaml
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: db
  username: user 
  password: passw
```

You will have to change the accesses indicated here by the real accesses to your database.

#### The second step is to configure the votes websites
You have to look at the websites key of the configuration file, the typical configuration for a voting site looks like this:
```yaml
serveur_PriveNet:
  enabled: true
  votePage: 'https://serveur-prive.net/minecraft/ivernya-3422'
  serverId: '5GHP0copFW7AlCi'
```
There are 3 particular values:
- `enabled`: true or false, this allows you to enable or disable one of the voting sites supported by the plugin.
